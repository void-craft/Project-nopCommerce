# Project nopCommerce

## Description:

* This framework is a comprehensive hybrid test suite for the admin site of the nopCommerce website.

* It includes test cases for login, customer addition, searching for customers using email, name and role.

* The project uses the Page Object Model and Selenium with Python to provide an efficient and scalable testing solution.

* The framework reads login data from an Excel spreadsheet and logs test results, including screenshots of failed test cases.

* Additionally, it compiles HTML test results for easy viewing and analysis.

* One notable feature of this project is its backend testing capability.

* By testing the admin site, it ensures the website's backend functions correctly, allowing for a seamless customer experience.
